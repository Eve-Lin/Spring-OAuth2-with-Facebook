# Spring Boot with OAuth2
The project strives to provide a simple example on how to implement "social login". We start with a single sign-on using Facebook. 
For that you need a registration on: 
developers.facebook.com
where you need to register your app in order to get your client id & client secret, which you need to specify in the 
application.yaml. You can also use env. variables for those, so that you don't expose them directly in the file
